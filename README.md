## Supporting Black-Owned Businesses in Times of Change

BlackEndpoints is a web application designed to help users discover and support local Black-owned businesses in their area. In response to recent rollbacks of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives across various sectors, this platform serves as a crucial tool for economic empowerment and community solidarity.

## Why This Matters

Recent developments have seen many corporations and institutions scaling back their DEI programs, potentially impacting opportunities and support for Black businesses and professionals. BlackEndpoints addresses this challenge by:

- Facilitating direct connections between consumers and Black-owned businesses
- Promoting economic self-reliance within the Black community
- Creating visibility for Black entrepreneurs and their enterprises
- Strengthening local economic ecosystems
